identifying side (no-trend) by ADX<25 for a while, then use RSI for trade on both sides, along with smart tp-sl, maybe using range indicators
trade based on RSI, adjusting levels based on ADX
identifying trend by MACD/SMA, then confirm by ADX>25 and +DI>-DI, then use RSI for trade on trend direction.

opter doesn't work
1. deciding best ima based on internet, optimising trade manager, sl/tp
	longer ima's, or MACD. in up trend RSI doesn't go back to 30 typ. so, if below 50 then crosses above 50: buy
2. long term: another way of finding optimum ima


Note: shorter ima (10 e.g.) for shorter time frames like 15min, longer(100) for daily
